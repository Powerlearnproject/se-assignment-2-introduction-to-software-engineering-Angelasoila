2. Planning- Develop a plan, Define scope, budget, schedule.
3. Execution- Assign tasks, Ensure quality assuarance, Implement plans.
4. Monitoring and controlling- Track process, Perform quality control, Report performance.
5. Closure- Release project resources, Finalize project activities, Document.

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.

Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Differences.
1. Agile is more flexible allowing change throughout the development while waterfall is rigid.
2. Agile encourages frequent customer involvement throught the project to give feedback while waterfall involves customers only at the start and end.
3. Agile mitigate risks through iterative development and regular reviews while waterfall relies on upfront risk mitigation.
4. Agile prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation, while Waterfall places a strong emphasis on detailed documentation at each phase of the process.

Preferred Scenarios:

Agile:
-Agile is preferred for projects with changing or unclear requirements, where flexibility and adaptability are essential.
-It is suitable for projects with high customer involvement and a need for rapid delivery of value.
-Agile is well-suited for small to medium-sized teams and projects with evolving technologies.

Waterfall:
-Waterfall is preferred for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, where predictability and control are crucial.
-It is suitable for projects with strict regulatory or compliance requirements, where comprehensive documentation and traceability are necessary.
-Waterfall may be preferred for large-scale projects with a clear understanding of the entire scope upfront.


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

-Requirements Engineering ensures that the problem a client wants solved is clearly defined and the solution is both accurate and effective.
1. Elicitation- engage with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
2. Analysis and documentation- analyze gathered requirements and document them.
3. Specification- define clear requirements of what the stakeholders expect.
4. Validation- validate the requirements with stakeholders to ensure they represent their needs.
5. Mangement- manage and control changes to requirements through out the software development cycle.

Importance.
1. Reduced development risks.
2. Cost and time savings.
3. Quality assuarance.
4. Alignment with stakeholder's needs.
5. Communication and collaborations.
6. Basis for design and development.
7. Customer satisfaction.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

-Modularity is a fundamental design principle in software engineering aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system.

Maintainability:
a. Simplified Changes:
-Since modules are self-contained and have clear interfaces, changes to one module are less likely to affect others.
b. Easier Debugging:
-Bugs can often be isolated to specific modules, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues.
c. Clearer Structure:
-A modular design provides a clear and organized structure, making it easier for new developers to understand the system.

Scalability:
a. Independent Development:
-Teams can work on different modules concurrently without causing conflicts.
b. Load Distribution:
-Modular systems can distribute workloads across different servers or services, each handling specific modules.
c. Flexibility in Deployment:
-Modules can be deployed independently, allowing for more flexible and targeted scaling.


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

1. Unit testing involves testing the smallest, individual components or units of the software, such as functions, methods, or classes, in isolation.
2. Integration testing checks the interactions between different units or components of the software to ensure they work together as expected.
3. System testing evaluates the entire, integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
4. Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end-users.

Why testing is crucial.
1. Risk mitigation
2. Performance validation.
3. Security assuarance.
4. Ensures quality.
5. Early bug detection.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version Control Systems- are tools that help manage changes to source code and other project files over time. They allow multiple people to collaborate on a project, track the history of changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.

Importances
1. Collaboration- allows different programmers to work on a project simultaneously.
2. History tracking- keeps a detailed log of changes made on the project
3. Reversion and recovery- enables developers to revert to previous versions if the new ones introduce bugs.
4. Branching and merging- Developers can create branches to work on new features or fixes independently from the main codebase. These branches can later be merged back.
5. Automation and Continuous Integration- VCS integrates with other tools for automated testing, building, and deployment.
6. Code Review and Quality Assurance- VCS facilitate code reviews by allowing team members to comment on changes and suggest improvement

Examples.
Git: features: Distributed model, Performance, Intergration, Branching and merging, Staging area, Commit history.
Subversion:features: Directory versioning, centralized repository, Branching and tagging, access control.
Azure DevOps: features: Access control, Branching and merging, Intergrated environment, Code reviews.
